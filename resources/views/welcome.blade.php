                        Eve
                        made babies, then
                        their babies became adults and made babies, and so on."
                        The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him, "We were
                        monkeys
                        then we evolved to become like we are now."
                        The child ran back to his father and said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom
                        was
                        talking about her side of the family."</p>
